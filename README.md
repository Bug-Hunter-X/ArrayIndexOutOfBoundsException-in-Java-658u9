# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The code attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range, leading to a runtime exception.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The solution, which corrects the loop condition to prevent the error, is in `bugSolution.java`.
